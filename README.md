Geocoding and Web Scrapping

This project is to conduct web-scrapping from a list of hotel in Houston, TX from TripAdvisor.com. For geocoding, a process of converting from addresses into xy coordinates, I will use the api service from  The Texas A&M Geoservices website http://geoservices.tamu.edu.  

After these procedure, I will combine the data sets with hotel price and quanity information that are retrived from Text Hotel Performance Factbook from Source Strategy, 

Source of Data and Geocoding Service

1. Hotel attributes and address (from TripAdvisor.com)

2. Geographic information (from the Texas A&M Geoservice)

3. Hotel prices and quantity information (from Source Strategy. Inc)

I will update this papge as the proceducre will go.
